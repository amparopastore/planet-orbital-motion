# Orbital Motion

This project has 2 parts: Orbital 1 & Orbital 2.

### Orbital 1

In the early 17th century Kepler used detailed observations of the orbit of mars to propose three laws ruling the motion of planets around their star:

1. The orbits of planets are ellipses. The star occupies a focus of that ellipse.
2. The line joining the star and the planet sweeps area at a constant rate.
3. The square of the period of the orbit is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis.

In the late 17th century, Newton proposed his theory of mechanics and gravitation and showed it does predict all three of Kepler's laws. The objective of this notebook is to use scipy's numerical integration function, solve_ivp, to solve Newton's equations of orbital motion and verify Kepler's laws.

### Orbital 2

This project aims to simulate and visualize orbital maneuvers using numerical integration of equations of motion. Specifically, it focuses on simulating a Hohmann transfer orbit, which is used to transfer a spacecraft from one circular orbit to another by way of an elliptical orbit. The project also involves using a Hohmann transfer orbit to bring a satellite from a low Earth orbit to an orbit around the Moon.
As we have seen in the last couple of weeks, computational methods of analyzing data to make accurate predictions are relevant in a variety of areas, and orbital mechanics is no exception. The significance of this project, therefore, lies in understanding the role that computational science plays in orbital mechanics and basic simulation techniques used in space mission planning.
